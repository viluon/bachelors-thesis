	abstract = {The R programming language has been lazy for over twenty-five years. This paper presents a review of the design and implementation of call-by-need in R, and a data-driven study of how generations of programmers have put laziness to use in their code. We analyze 16,707 packages and observe the creation of 270.9 B promises. Our data suggests that there is little supporting evidence to assert that programmers use laziness to avoid unnecessary computation or to operate over infinite data structures. For the most part R code appears to have been written without reliance on, and in many cases even knowledge of, delayed argument evaluation. The only significant exception is a small number of packages which leverage call-by-need for meta-programming.},

	abstract = {Quasiquoting allows programmers to use domain specific syntax to construct program fragments. By providing concrete syntax for complex data types, programs become easier to read, easier to write, and easier to reason about and maintain. Haskell is an excellent host language for embedded domain specific languages, and quasiquoting ideally complements the language features that make Haskell perform so well in this area. Unfortunately, until now no Haskell compiler has provided support for quasiquoting. We present an implementation in GHC and demonstrate that by leveraging existing compiler capabilities, building a full quasiquoter requires little more work than writing a parser. Furthermore, we provide a compile-time guarantee that all quasiquoted data is type-correct.},
