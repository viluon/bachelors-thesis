This is the [text](./BP_Kvapil_Ond≈ôej_2020.pdf) of my bachelor's thesis on
dynamic tracing of Haskell programs, along with the accompanying
[talk](./talk.pdf). If you'd rather a deflated PDF freshly out of the oven,
grab an artifact from one of the [workflow
runs](https://github.com/viluon/bachelors-thesis/actions/workflows/compile-latex.yaml).

## Submission process

The submission deadline is Thursday, 13th May, 2021. Thankfully, the required
steps are detailed
[here](https://help.fit.cvut.cz/projects-fit/processes/index.html).
